# Machine Learning courses with exercises
[`DL_note.pdf`](https://github.com/JSKao/ML_Phys/blob/master/DL_note.pdf) is the note I wrote in Ng's courses ['Deep Learning Specialization'](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).
In [MLPHY1 - Ising MC and NN.ipynb](https://github.com/JSKao/ML_Phys/blob/master/MLPHY1%20-%20Ising%20MC%20and%20NN.ipynb), MCMC sampling of Ising configuration is done and neural network from scratch is applied to classify the phases of Ising model.
